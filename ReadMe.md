# Notice！

>This is a copy of the official code of AML.

The official repo of AML (https://github.com/MLanHu/AML) has been recently deleted (September 7, 2022). Thus we re-uploaded the copy we downloaded before.

This copy is the latest version, and we do **not** make any changes to it.

Note that `main.py` is incomplete, but that was the case in the original version.

Below is the original ReadMe content:

## Introduction
This is a pytorch implementation of binary matching case described in *'Adversarial-Metric Learning for Audio-Visual Cross-Modal Matching'*  
![network](Experimental%20Result/network.png)

## Requirements
python 3.6  
librosa 0.7.2  
numpy 1.19.0  
torch 1.4.0  
torchvision 0.5.0  

## Dataset
The network are trained on images from the and VGGFace dataset, and audio segments from VoxCeleb1. The VGGFace can be download from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/CMBiometrics/data/zippedFaces.tar.gz). The VoxCeleb1 can be downloaded from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/).

## Experimental Result
### Comparison Results of the proposed method
Here are the comparison results of audio-visual matching against state-of-the-art methods on both binary (k = 2) and multi-way (k = 10) cases.

### Qualitative Results of the proposed method
Here are the qualitative results of audio-visual cross-modal matching of the proposed AML comparing to DIMNet, SVHF-Net in A → V challenge with k = 2.
